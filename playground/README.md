# Pyfun Playground (WebAssembly)

The real Pyfun compiler, built to WebAssembly, compiling Pyfun to readable Python
**live in the browser** as you type. It's a separate crate so the core `pyfun`
compiler stays dependency-free — only this shim (`src/lib.rs`) depends on
`wasm-bindgen`, and it just calls the same pure `pyfun::analyze` / `pyfun::compile`
entry points the CLI and LSP use, so the Python shown is byte-for-byte the CLI's output.

## Build

Prerequisites (the Rust toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`):

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack
```

From the repo root, build the WASM package into `playground/web/pkg/`:

```bash
wasm-pack build playground --target web --out-dir web/pkg --release
```

WASM ES modules don't load over `file://`, so serve the folder over HTTP:

```bash
python -m http.server -d playground/web 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

`wasm-pack` runs natively on Windows — no WSL needed to build or serve.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

[`.github/workflows/playground.yml`](../.github/workflows/playground.yml) builds the
WASM and publishes `playground/web/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. Enable it
once under **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**; after that the playground is
live at your Pages URL, ready to link from the README and launch posts.

## Recording the demo GIF from it

The playground is a normal web page, so record it natively on any OS — no `ttyd`/WSL:

- **Quick:** [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (Windows), Kap (macOS), or Peek
  (Linux) — capture the two panes as you type.
- **Reproducible:** a Playwright script that types into `#editor` and records video, then
  `ffmpeg` to GIF — the browser equivalent of a VHS tape, and it runs on Windows.

## What it does

- **Compiles live.** Parse, type/effect/exhaustiveness-check, and lower to Python —
  everything the compiler does up to emitting source, with live diagnostics (the
  resilient `analyze`), as you type.
- **Runs it.** The **Run** button executes the emitted Python in **CPython itself**,
  compiled to WebAssembly ([Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)), and shows stdout. Pyodide runs
  in a **Web Worker** (`pyodide-worker.js`), off the main thread, so loading the ~10 MB
  runtime (lazy, on first Run, then cached) and executing code never freeze the UI. Each run
  uses a fresh namespace and captures stdout/stderr via a `StringIO` redirect; a Python
  exception shows its traceback. Programs that only touch the stdlib (`json`, `sqlite3`,
  `math`, `statistics`, `dataclasses`, …) run as-is; an `extern` for a third-party package
  (`numpy`, `requests`) would need `micropip` (not wired up) and network calls don't work in
  the sandbox.
